## Brainstorm Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic has been how gut microbiome composition reflects and potentially influences neurological and psychiatric conditions.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I’d like to investigate how depression and antidepressant use impact the gut microbiome and whether these changes are linked to increased Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would focus more on integrating clinical metadata (e.g., medication history, diagnosis) during preprocessing to enable more targeted subgroup comparisons and reduce confounding.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d like to explore supervised machine learning for classification (e.g., Random Forests) and potentially network analysis to examine microbial co-occurrence patterns.
